        Web development refers to the creation and maintenance of websites and
        web applications. It involves several aspects, including web design, web
        programming, and database management. The field of web development can
        be broadly divided into two main areas: front-end development and
        back-end development.

        Web development can be divided into two main categories: front-end
        development and back-end development. Front-end development deals with
        the visual aspects of a website or application, including the design,
        layout, and user interface. This involves working with HTML, CSS, and
        JavaScript to create web pages that can be viewed in a browser.
