        Programming is not about typing, it's about thinking. If you want to
        become a great programmer, you need to understand that the hardest part
        of programming is not writing code, but figuring out what you need to
        write.

        Good code is its own best documentation. As you're about to add a
        comment, ask yourself, 'How can I improve the code so that this comment
        isn't needed?

        The most important single aspect of software development is to be clear
        about what you are trying to build. If you do not know what you are
        trying to do, you are unlikely to do it. If you do know, you are almost
        certain to accomplish it.

        There are two ways of constructing a software design: One way is to make
        it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies, and the other way
        is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies. The
        first method is far more difficult.

        A software system is successful if the customer is happy. A happy
        customer is one who has a system that is easy to use, does what the
        customer wants, and doesn't crash. If you achieve these three goals, and
        your customer is happy, then all of your other concerns, such as code
        structure, ease of maintenance, cost, and so on, will be satisfied as
        well.
